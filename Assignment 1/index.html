            My name is Rafael Figueroa, I am a full-time student at CSUSB. I am a transfer student from
            Riverside City College, where I recieved my associates in computer science and social and behavioral studies.
            Originally I was a math-major, but when I took a required entry level computer science course of C++, I realized that
            I had a passion with programming that I didn't feel before while working in my math classes. Once I changed my major I have been working 
            towards acheiving my goal of becoming a software engineering.

            Besides my school I have a number of interest. One of my largest interest is cars, mortorcycles, and airplanes. When I am more financially
            stable I would like to build and race my own car around tracks in the united states and the world. I currently work on my own cars 
            and I am saving up for racing lessons. Somehow my interest has leaked into the airspace, as I have also developed a goal of wanting
            to aquire my pilots license.

            In order to survive I constantly listen to music. My music taste ranges from edm to 90's Japanese pop, and everything in betweeen.
            I love to go to concerts, festivals, and raves. Most of the time I spend outside of work and school I spend in a setting with music.
            I find music to be relaxing and even if I cant sing, I will always sing along to every song I know.
